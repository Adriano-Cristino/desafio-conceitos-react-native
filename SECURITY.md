# Security Issues Fixed

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to the React Native project.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

### Dependency Updates
- Updated Jest from v25.5.4 to v26.6.3 (resolved multiple critical vulnerabilities)
- Updated Babel packages to latest compatible versions
- Updated ESLint to v7.32.0 (from v6.8.0)
- Updated testing libraries to more secure versions
- Reduced total vulnerabilities from 323 to 66 (79% reduction)

### API Security Improvements
- Added environment-based URL configuration (HTTPS for production)
- Added request timeout (10 seconds) to prevent hanging requests
- Added proper error handling for API calls
- Added request interceptor to prevent sensitive headers in development
- Added Content-Type header for proper content handling

### Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks for async operations
- Added proper error logging for debugging
- Added graceful error handling for network failures

### Development Environment
- Added .nvmrc file for Node.js version consistency
- Fixed linting issues for better code quality

## Remaining Vulnerabilities
Most remaining vulnerabilities (66) are in React Native 0.62.3 dependencies:
- hermes-engine vulnerabilities (Critical/High)
- node-fetch vulnerabilities (High) 
- shell-quote vulnerabilities (Critical)
- Various transitive dependency issues

### Recommendations for Further Security Improvements
1. **Upgrade React Native**: Consider upgrading to a more recent version (0.70+)
2. **Dependency Monitoring**: Implement automated dependency scanning
3. **Security Headers**: Add security headers in production environment
4. **Input Validation**: Add proper input validation and sanitization
5. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms
6. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all production communications use HTTPS

## Security Best Practices Implemented
- Environment-based configuration
- Request timeouts
- Error handling
- Code quality improvements
- Version pinning
